    "## Step 1. \n",
    "To begin, you will need to decide on the image or shape you would like to convert into a marker. The only requirement is that you must have your image as a SVG file. It is possible to convert PDFs to SVGs, save digital drawings as SVGs, or find SVG clipart online. (Note: when taking images from the internet, always be aware of the copyright and how you will use them. Using copyrighted images once in a limited capacity for \"scholarly\" purposes (e.g., in your lectures, at a conference, etc.) falls under \"fair use\" and is fine, but using them in a way in which access is unlimited or you make money is not. If you're worried about legal ambiguity, it's best to stick to images in the public domain or under a creative commons license.)\n",
